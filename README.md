Basic wireframe:

Log in with Google OAuth or Github OAuth.
--You must log in and allow your location for the app to work. Sorry.

Top nav bar:
-- Login
-- Settings
-- are you a parent? changing station options? <--dream feature>
-- radius
-- home location
-- preferred sorting options? favorite categories?
-- build an umbrella category...??? <--dream feature>
-- favorites
--notifications? maybe if a favorite is about to open or close?
--about
-- specifically, this data is pulled from google. please don't be mad at me if it's outdated.
-- Logout

Immediately, the app says:
-- "(x) places open now. (x) within 30 minutes.

--Sorting options
-- alphabetical
-- when built, umbrellas first.

--List of places
-- each UL will have the category name, or umbrella of categories
-- each list item will have name, google rating, distance from you, YOUR rating, a heart button, and then maybe an error that says "hey they're open now but they'll be closed at (x, which is within two hours?)

    --when you click on a place, more details pop down. maybe a notes feature? (no shade, bring sunscreen, bring the big stroller or don't bring a stroller)

to do:
how to get MORE THINGSSSSSSSS
buttons for sorting? maybe get rid of the categorical breakdown. have the default be by distance?
what else should be in the drop down? i'd mentioned maybe a notes section. i don't think a user actually needs any reason to fully click on a card. maybe embed a form?
oh -- on that note, RATING IT! a user's rating!
maybe look into the distance api for actual distance?
make sure i'm actually getting all of the results. checking pagination? check other logged in users
build a settings page, figure out how to get the authentication working for seeded users
then....oauth.
finally, make it pretty. check it on a phone, because that's where i'll want to use it.
