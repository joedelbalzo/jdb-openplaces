Basic wireframe:

Log in with Google OAuth or Github OAuth.
--You must log in and allow your location for the app to work. Sorry.

Top nav bar:
-- Login
-- Settings
-- are you a parent? changing station options? <--dream feature>
-- radius
-- home location
-- preferred sorting options? favorite categories?
-- build an umbrella category...??? <--dream feature>
-- favorites
--notifications? maybe if a favorite is about to open or close?
--about
-- specifically, this data is pulled from google. please don't be mad at me if it's outdated.
-- Logout

Immediately, the app says:
-- "(x) places open now. (x) within 30 minutes.

--Sorting options
-- alphabetical
-- when built, umbrellas first.

--List of places
-- each UL will have the category name, or umbrella of categories
-- each list item will have name, google rating, distance from you, YOUR rating, a heart button, and then maybe an error that says "hey they're open now but they'll be closed at (x, which is within two hours?)

    --when you click on a place, more details pop down. maybe a notes feature? (no shade, bring sunscreen, bring the big stroller or don't bring a stroller)
